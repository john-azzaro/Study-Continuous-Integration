in development workflow.

## What is Continuous Integration (CI)?
**Continuous Integration**, or CI, is a development practice where developers integrate working copies of code to a central shared repository several
times a day.  When each integration is submitted to this shared repository, it is verified by an automatic build.

CI is envaluable to developers in that it can:
1. Solve problems quickly by detecting and locating errors.
2. Spend more tim ebuilding features instead of fixing problems. 
3. Help developers frequently integrate code often to communictae betwene engineers and get feedback. 
4. Make sure code is consistent.
5. Help make code much more dependable with automated testing. 
6. Make sure the code each dev is working on does not deviate too far from the a common plan of action.
7. Verify each integration via autmated build and automated tests.
